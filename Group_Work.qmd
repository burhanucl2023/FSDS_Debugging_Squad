## 1. Who collected the data?

The data for the Inside Airbnb Project is collected and managed by the project itself. The data utilizes public information compiled from the Airbnb website including the availability calendar for 365 days in the future, and the reviews for each listing. Data is verified, cleansed, analyzed, and aggregated. Inside Airbnb was founded by Murray Cox, an artist, activist and technologist who conceived the project, compiled and analyzed the data, and built the site. John Morris, a designer and artist, designed and directed the user experience. Apart from these two, Taylor Higgins works to build and organize the data and activist communities of Inside Airbnb.(http://insideairbnb.com/about/).

The project also has a process for handling archived data requests, where requests for larger amounts of data, historical data, or data for uses outside the project's mission may be assessed and, in some cases, refused or subject to payment.

## 2. Why did they collect it?

Founded in 2008, Airbnb is a company providing a peer to peer platform for short-term rental accommodations. Private and commercial entities can offer whole accommodations or individual rooms for rent through the website or app. Today, Airbnb has over 4 million active hosts (https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/).

Inside Airbnb is a mission-driven activist project with the objective to make information about the impact of Airbnb on local communities available. The objective is to "provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities, as well as create a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals" (http://insideairbnb.com/data-policies).

The main purpose is not only to quantify these impacts, but also to build a platform for advocating for policies that safeguard cities from the negative repercussions of short-term rentals. Inside Airbnb data is used as a tool for housing and community activists, journalists, residents, and local administration to better understand, regulate, and manage concerns related to Airbnb and other short-term rental sites.

## 3. How was the data collected?  

::: {.duedate}

( 5 points; Answer due Week 8 )
The data on Inside Airbnb was collected through a process of web scraping from the Airbnb website. The data on individual Airbnb Listings is extracted from the Airbnb website for a specified search area, e.g. a city. Inside Airbnb has collected data for a range of cities in Europe and North America (92 cities). For Asia and the Pacific, Africa and South America data was collected only for a few major cities (21 cities) (see: http://insideairbnb.com/explore). 

For each listing, Inside Airbnb collects a variety of data points including on the host (e.g. host name, ID, location, description, picture, total listings count), on the location (e.g. neighborhood, longitude and latitude), on the property (e.g. description, picture, property type, how many people it accommodates, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, beds and other amenities), on the price, on the stay (e.g. min and maximum number of nights and availability),and on reviews (e.g. number of reviews, overall satisfaction rating but not individual reviews). 

According to the website, the collected data is verified, cleansed, analyzed and aggregated by Inside Airbnb. (http://insideairbnb.com/data-assumptions/)

## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

::: {.duedate}

( 11 points; Answer due Week 9 )

Inside Airbnb seeks to provide data to study Airbnb’s impact on residential communities. Web scraping the Airbnb website as a method for data collection means that the dataset shows a snapshot of listings available at a particular time. The Airbnb website is changing continuously as users add, delete or change listings. As illustrated by Cox and Slee (2016), the website can dramatically change from one day to the next. In 2015, Airbnb published data on their operation in New York using a snapshot of November 17, 2015. The data was misleading as they did not show that a  targeted purge of more than 1,000 listings was implemented just before that date. In order to accurately study the impact of Airbnb on local communities, comparing data over time would be beneficial. 

For the London dataset, used in this assignment, the Airbnb website was scraped on two dates 023-09-06 and 2023-09-07. The dataset seems to be fairly complete. NA values are prominent (over 1000 na values) in the columns reviews_per_month, licence, review_scores_rating_bathroom, bedrooms.
